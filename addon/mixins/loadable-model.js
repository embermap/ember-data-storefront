/**
  This mixin adds new data-loading methods to your Ember Data models.

  To use it, extend a model and mix it in:

  ```js
  // app/models/post.js
  import DS from 'ember-data';
  import LoadableModel from 'ember-data-storefront/mixins/loadable-model';

  export default DS.Model.extend(LoadableModel);
  ```

  Once you understand how `LoadableModel` works We suggest adding it to every model in your app. You can do this by reopening `DS.Model` in `app.js.` and mixing it in:

  ```js
  // app/app.js
  import DS from 'ember-data';
  import LoadableModel from 'ember-data-storefront/mixins/loadable-model';

  DS.Model.reopen(LoadableModel);
  ```

  @class LoadableModel
  @public
*/
export default Mixin.create({

  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    this.set('_loadedReferences', {});
  },

  reloadWith(...args) {
    deprecate(
      'reloadWith has been renamed to sideload. Please change all instances of reloadWith in your app to sideload. reloadWith will be removed in 1.0',
      false,
      { id: 'ember-data-storefront.reloadWith', until: '1.0.0' }
    );

    return this.sideload(...args);
  },

   /**
    `sideload` gives you an explicit way to asynchronously sideload related data.

    ```js
    post.sideload('comments');
    ```

    The above uses Storefront's `loadRecord` method to query your backend for the post along with its comments.

    You can also use JSON:API's dot notation to load additional related relationships.

    ```js
    post.sideload('comments.author');
    ```

    Every call to `sideload()` will return a promise.

    ```js
    post.sideload('comments').then((post) => console.log('loaded comments!'));
    ```

    If a relationship has never been loaded, the promise will block until the data is loaded. However, if a relationship has already been loaded (even from calls to `loadRecord` elsewhere in your application), the promise will resolve synchronously with the data from Storefront's cache. This means you don't have to worry about overcalling `sideload()`.

    When relationship data has already been loaded, `sideload` will use a background refresh to update the relationship. To prevent sideload from making network requests for data that has already been loaded, use the `{ backgroundReload: false }` option.

    ```js
    post.sideload('comments', { backgroundReload: false });
    ```

    If you would like calls to `sideload` to always return a blocking promise, use the `{ reload: true }` option.

    ```js
    post.sideload('comments', { reload: true })
    ```

    This feature works best when used on relationships that are defined with `{ async: false }` because it allows `load()` to load the data, and `get()` to access the data that has already been loaded.

    This method relies on JSON:API and assumes that your server supports JSON:API includes.

    @method sideload
    @param {String} includesString a JSON:API includes string representing the relationships to check
    @param {Object} options (optional) a hash of options
    @return {Promise} a promise resolving with the record

    let modelName = this.constructor.modelName;
    let possibleOptions = args[args.length - 1];
    let options;

    if (typeof possibleOptions === 'string') {
      options = {
        include: args.join(',')
      };
    } else {
      options = {
        ...possibleOptions,
        ...{ include: args.slice(0,-1).join(',') }
      };
